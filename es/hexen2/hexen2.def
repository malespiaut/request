/*QUAKED breakable_brush (0.0 0.0 1.0) ? KILLALL HIERARCH NOLINK CHECKNAME ORDERED TRANSLUCENT INVINCIBLE INVISIBLE
Breakable window or wall

You can manually control the heirarchy of breaking by targeting all the brushes you want this brush to break.
If you target a light with this object and turn on the "breaklight" spawnflag, it will turn off that light when it's broken.  The light will default to 300 if no lightvalue1 is given.

AUTOMATIC LINKING OPTIONS:
killall - when killed, the brush will kill all connected brushes
hierarch - link all brushes in a hierarchy.  The hierarchy priority is set in the 
			  frags field of each brush.  Lower numbers will kill higher numbers.  If
			  brushes share the same priority, they will die at the same time.
nolink - don't automatically link this brush with other brushes (use only manual targeting to link)
checkname - link brushes, but also check the name you place in the netname field.
				Brushes must then not only touch, but also have the same netname to link
ordered - like hierarch, except that no matter which brush you kill, the brushes 
			 will always break in a certain order.  The order is set in the frags field.
			 The brush with a frags set to 1 will break first, brush with frags set to
			 2 will break second, etc.

OTHER FIELDS:
translucent - you can see through it
invincible - can't be shot and broken, but will break by linking

Key doors are allways wait -1.

You need to have an origin brush as part of this entity.  The  
center of that brush will be
the point around which it is rotated. It will rotate around the Z  
axis by default.  You can
check either the X_AXIS or Y_AXIS box to change that.

REVERSE will cause the door to rotate in the opposite direction.

"flags" is how many degrees the door will be rotated.
"message"	is printed when the door is touched if it is a trigger door and it hasn't been fired yet
"targetname" if set, no touch field will be spawned and a remote button or trigger field activates the door.

/*QUAKED func_monsterspawn_spot (1.0 0.3 0.0) (-16 -16 0) (16 16 56) IMP ARCHER WIZARD SCORPION SPIDER ONDEATH QUIET
All this does is mark where to spawn monsters for a spawn spot.

You can set any monster type for each spawnspot.

Just make the spawnername of this entity equal to the spawnername of the spawner and the spawner will cycle through all it's spawnspots in the world.

If you don't set the aflag, the spawn spot will NOT be used.

Note that if you set a trigger to activate this spawnspot, you can have it turn on and be included in the spawner's cycle, but you still always have to set the aflag.

aflag = order in the spawning cycle, you MUST set this, or it's useless.
cnt = number of monsters this spot will spawn, defaults to 17.
spawnername = this HAS to match the spawner's spawnername!
wait = how long the minimum interval should be between monster spawns for THIS spot.
targetname = used if you want this to wait to be activated by a seperate trigger before being included in the spawning cycle.

/*QUAKED func_monsterspawner (1.0 0.8 0.0) (-16 -16 0) (16 16 56) IMP ARCHER WIZARD SCORPION SPIDER ONDEATH QUIET TRIGGERONLY
If something is blocking the spawnspot, this will telefrag it as long as it's not a living entity (flags2&FL_ALIVE)

You can set up as many spots as you want for it to spawn at and it will cycle
between these.  Make them classname func_monsterspawn_spot and
their spawnername has to match this entity's spawnername.
You can control the order in which they are used by setting thier
aflag (1, 2, 3, etc- there is NO ZERO, that's for you designers!)
You should give the spawner an aflag too if you want it's origin
included in the cycle of spawning, but if there are no spawn spots (just a spawner), no aflag is needed anywhere.

WARNING!!!  If you forget to put spawnspots and you give the spawner a spawnername, it will go into an infinite loop and the Universe will cease to exist!

If you only want monsters to spawn at the monster spawner origin, then don't worry about aflags or the spawnername, it will know... It's that cool.

The Monsters will be spawned at the origin of the spawner (and/or spawnspots), so if you want them not to stick in the ground, put this above the ground some- maybe 24?  Make sure there's enough room around it for the monsters.

ONDEATH = only spawn the new monster after the last has died, defaults to FALSE (doesn't wait)
TRIGGERONLY = Will only spawn a monster when it's been used by a trigger.  The default is continous spawning.
wait = time to wait after spawning a monster until the next monster is spawned, defaults to 0.5 seconds. If there are multiple spawn spots, this will be the time between cycles (default 0.5)
cnt = number of monsters, max to spawn, defaults to 17 (no reason, just like that number!)	If there are multiple spots, this should be the total off ALL the spots, including the spawner itself.
aflag = order in the spawning cycle
spawnername = spawnspots to look for- be sure to make spawnspots!
targetname = not needed unless you plan to activate this with a trigger

There will be a test on this on Thursday.  Interns are NOT exempt.

It will rotate around the Z axis by default.  You can
check either the X_AXIS or Y_AXIS box to change that.
BREAK makes the brush breakable
REVERSE will cause the it to rotate in the opposite direction.
GRADUAL will make it slowly speed up and slow down.
TOGGLE_REVERSE will make it go in the other direction next time it's triggered
KEEP_START means it will return to it's starting position when turned off

"dmg"	damage to inflict when blocked (2 default)
"lifetime" this will make it stop after a while, then start up again after "wait".  Default is staying on.
"wait" if it has a lifetime, this is how long it will wait to start up again.  default is 3 seconds.
"thingtype" type of brush (if breakable - default is wood)
"health" (if breakable - default is 25)

Trains are moving platforms that players can ride.

"distance" - in pixels, how far to move
"speed" - how fast it moves between spots (default=100)
"anglespeed" - how fast it rotates to a new angle (default = 100)
"wait" - -1 will make it stop forever, -2 will make it blow up (you can put the waits on the pathcorners and it will take the wait from there.
"pausetime" - How long to wait after getting to the end of it's path before blowing up, default is 0

The train will modify it's angles by whatever angles it's next path point has, so if it heads towards a path corner with an angle of '0 90 0', the train will rotate '0 90 0' on it's way to the pathpoint.  If you make the anglespeed the same as the angle, the turn should finish right as the train gets to the new spot.

NOTE: A path_corner using spawnflag "SYNCH" will make the train automatically calculate a new anglespeed based on the distance it's going and will finish the turn at the same time the move is done.

As usual, any rotating brush needs an origin brush.

:model=:models/megaweb.mdl
Big webby stuff.
Origin is in the center.
Note that the web is only 46 wide and 2 or 3 pixels thick, and 50 tall.

SOLID = Make it so you can walk on it and not pass though it.
ANIMATE = give it a slight constant animation so it looks like it's being moved by a breeze.  Looks best on cobwebs and corner web.
WEAK = This will make it break apart upon touch.
TOUCHMOVE = Will cycle through it's animation once only when touched, not meant to be used with any other spawnflag
FLAT = Meant to be used with solid, this will lay it out flat (all you have to do then is give it it's yaw angle) and adjust the bounding box size so it can be walked on.
NOTRANS = No translucency, totally solid coloring

FEILDS:
-----------------------------
abslight = Spiderwebs may need to be brighter or darker than their surroundings to look best.
health = default is 0, which means it won't take damage, otherwise, you can shoot it away or, if it has low health, you can break it by landing very hard on it
skin = default is 0 
	0 = many little spider webs
	1 = corner web, will appear in right side of the front of the box.
	2 = cobwebs, light and very nice looking
	3 = One giant web
	4 = One big-ass web, 15 times normal size.
scale = scale it up or down, note that this defaults to 1, and the maximum is 2.5

THESE ANGLES ARE RELATIVE TO IT'S FRONT (given by angle at bottom)
v_angle_x = how much pitch to tilt it front-back
v_angle_y = how much yaw to turn it (same as angle field at bottom)
v_angle_z = how much roll to tilt it sideways
These can also be entered in one field, such as:
v_angle = 0 0 0 (x, y, z)

/*QUAKED path_corner (0.5 0.3 0.0) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) SYNCH
Monsters will continue walking towards the next target corner.

FOR TRAINS:
-------------------------FIELDS-------------------------
SYNCH - Will make the train automatically calculate a new anglespeed based on the distance it's going and will finish the turn at the same time the move is done.
"speed" - how fast the train should move to this path corner.  This will change the train's default speed to whatever you specify.  Nice for trains that should speed up and slow down.  No speed will let the train move at whatever speed it was last set to.
"angles" - how much to modify the train's angles by.  So if you set it at '0 90 0', and the train was at an angle of '30 60 90', the train would rotate unitl it's angles equalled '30 150 90'
"anglespeed" - how fast the train should rotate to the new angle.  Again, this will change the train's default anglespeed.
The defaults of all of these are 0.

As usual, any rotating brush needs an origin brush.

/*QUAKED trigger_counter (0.5 0.5 0.5) ? nomessage ordered always_return deactivated
Acts as an intermediary for an action that takes multiple inputs.

nomessage = it will print "1 more.. " etc when triggered and "sequence complete" when finished.
ordered = things must be triggered in order to make the counter go off
always_return = Buttons will pop back to ready position even if successful (default is that they stay down once correct combination is found)

 - The triggers that trigger the counter need to be ordered using the "aflag" field
 - The first trigger is 1, second is 2, etc.
 - If a trigger is hit out of order, the counter resets
 - Triggers need a name in their netname function, the same name must be in the counter triggers netname fields (the target of the counter should NOT have a netname field, only the things triggering the counter)
 - Count must still be the number of triggers until the counter fires, minus 1 (don't ask why)

"wait" = how long to wait after successful before giving it another try.  Default is -1, meaning it works once and shut off.  If you specify a wait time, the trigger will become a multiple trigger.
"mangle" = This entity has the ability to have a non-sequential sequence of numbers as a combination using mangle.
The format is like a vector, for example, if you want the counter (ordered) to work only if the cnt order of 3, 5, 7 is used, enter the value "3 5 7" (no quotes).
A trigger_combination_assign trigger can pass it's "mangle" value to trigger_counter when it uses it.
This way you can have a number of different possible combinations that could be used and only one wouldbe right (depending, say, on which path the player took).
The values can be as high as you like (okay, from 1 to 65336), so you can have any number of buttons in this puzzle.

After the counter has been triggered "count" times (default 2), it will fire all of it's targets and shut off, unless you specify a wait time.
