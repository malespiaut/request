wait - time to wait between spawnings (default 10)


The following fields can be applied to the func_monsterspawner so that the monsters spawned from it will have the values you give them.  The defaults are the monster's normal defaults.  Monsters who do not use buoys may not use all of these fields (ie: rats, harpies, fish, imps, etc.)

mintel - monster intelligence- this basically tells a monster how many buoys away an enemy has to be for it to give up.

melee_range - How close the player has to be, maximum, for the monster to go into melee.  If this is zero, the monster will never melee.  If it is negative, the monster will try to keep this distance from the player.  If the monster has a backup, he'll use it if too clode, otherwise, a negative value here means the monster will just stop running at the player at this distance.
	Examples:
		melee_range = 60 - monster will start swinging it player is closer than 60
		melee_range = 0 - monster will never do a mele attack
		melee_range = -100 - monster will never do a melee attack and will back away (if it has that ability) when player gets too close

missile_range - Maximum distance the player can be from the monster to be allowed to use it's ranged attack.

min_missile_range - Minimum distance the player can be from the monster to be allowed to use it's ranged attack.

bypass_missile_chance - Chance that a monster will NOT fire it's ranged attack, even when it has a clear shot.  This, in effect, will make the monster come in more often than hang back and fire.  A percentage (0 = always fire/never close in, 100 = never fire/always close in).- must be whole number

jump_chance - every time the monster has the opportunity to jump, what is the chance (out of 100) that he will... (100 = jump every time)- must be whole number

wakeup_distance - How far (max) the player can be away from the monster before it wakes up.  This just means that if the monster can see the player, at what distance should the monster actually notice him and go for him.

	therefore:
  2) Thou shalt connect each buoy to up to three other buoies (only three lines can come off a buoy)
  3) Thou shalt knowest that direction of connection does not matter unless you are trying to make a one-way buoy (see ONEWAY) below
  4) Thou shalt place thine buoy in an area that a monster can fit into
  5) Thou shalt place thine buoies such that each buoy can "see" each buoy it's conencted to (have a clear line of sight)
  6) Thou shalt knowest that buoies do not need to be placed throughout wide open areas, monsters can get around fine there.
  7) Thou shalt not place buoies in the ground or walls or any other world object
  8) Thou shalt not give any two buoies the same targetname, and each buoy should have a targetname, even if it is not targeted (this is for debug purposes)
  9) Thou shalt not have any other AI system above the BUOYAH! Navigation System.

Keep in mind that when choosing a buoy, monsters need to be able to find a buoy withing 1024 map units of them.  So make sure buoies are placed so that wherever they can get, they are within 1024 of a buoy.

"showbuoys" - At the console, setting "showbuoys" to 1 and restarting the map will allow you to see each buoy.  The flags you will see are each monster's indicator of where they are trying to go at the minute.  In addition you will get buoy debug messages on the console in this mode, telling you if a monster has a hard time getting to a buoy (it times out) or if, for some reason, a connection cannot be made between two buoies.
"cheating_monsters" - At the console, set this to 1 to allow monsters to teleport to a buoy it's having a hard time getting to.

Lots of info and useful instructions here:
JUMP - Will make monster jump ("angle" is the direction to go in (default = 0), "speed" if the forward velocity in this dir (default = 400), "height" is the height of the jump (default = 400))
ACTIVATE - Will allow monster to activate doors, triggers, plats, etc.  NOTE: the activated object's "pathtargetname" must match the buoy's "pathtarget" field.
(not implemented) TURN - Will make monster turn to buoy's angles
ONEWAY - This buoy will not allow buoys it's targeting to send monsters backwards along the path.  Basically, does not back-link, paths from it to buoys it's targeting become one-way.

"jumptarget" - used with JUMP - this buoy will only make monsters jump at the buoy whose "targetname" is the same as "jumpbuoy"- without this, the buoy WILL NOT MAKE MONSTERS JUMP!
"wait" - used with ACTIVATE- will make the buoy wait this many seconds before allowing a monster to activate the targeted ent again
"delay" - used with ACTIVATE - will make the monster stand and wait this long after activating the target ent (so it stands and waits on a lift or for the door to open)

NOTE: AVOID GRIEVOUS DESIGN ERRORS!

DEBUG INFO:
For "showbuoys" = 2, in addition to the arrow paths indicating target->targetname direction, particles appear on buoys, here's what each color indicates:
red - the buoy a monster has determined is your closest buoy
green - the buoy a monster has determined is it's next buoy to get to
cyan - this buoy has a jump flag
blue - this buoy is the jumptarget of a jump flagged buoy
magenta - this buoy has an activate flag
white - this buoy has an oneway flag

Standing over a buoy that has a spawnflag of BUOY_JUMP or BUOY_ACTIVATE and hitting "action" will print it's info to the console is in "showbuoys" mode

The assassin 

SPAWNFLAGS:

AMBUSH - Will not be woken up by other monsters or shots from player

ASLEEP - will not appear until triggered

WALKING - use WANDER instead

FwdJumpAmbush - will jump out front or back when triggered (depending on whether player is in front or behind him)

NoCloak - can't turn into a shadow

NoTeleport - can't use smoke grenades to trick player and teleport

CINEMATIC - puts monster into cinematic mode for scripting

FIXED - Will stand in place and attack from afar.  Never moves.

WANDER - Monster will wander around aimlessly (but follows buoys)

MELEE_LEAD - Monster will tryto cut you off when you're running and fighting him, works well if there are a few monsters in a group, half doing this, half not

STALK - Monster will only approach and attack from behind- if you're facing the monster it will just stand there.  Once the monster takes pain, however, it will stop this behaviour and attack normally

COWARD - Monster starts off in flee mode- runs away from you when woken up

TeleportAmbush - Will teleport into his origin when triggered (before triggered, is not anywhere at all, like "ASLEEP")

CloakAmbush - Start as a shadow and decloak when wakes up

SideJumpAmbush - Will jump out to left or right (depending on which side of the assassin the player is)

TeleportDodge - Can use teleporting to dodge attacks

FIELDS:

"homebuoy" - monsters will head to this buoy if they don't have an enemy ("homebuoy" should be targetname of the buoy you want them to go to)

"wakeup_target" - monsters will fire this target the first time it wakes up (only once)

"pain_target" - monsters will fire this target the first time it gets hurt (only once)

mintel - monster intelligence- this basically tells a monster how many buoys away an enemy has to be for it to give up.

melee_range - How close the player has to be, maximum, for the monster to go into melee.  If this is zero, the monster will never melee.  If it is negative, the monster will try to keep this distance from the player.  If the monster has a backup, he'll use it if too clode, otherwise, a negative value here means the monster will just stop running at the player at this distance.
	Examples:
		melee_range = 60 - monster will start swinging it player is closer than 60
		melee_range = 0 - monster will never do a mele attack
		melee_range = -100 - monster will never do a melee attack and will back away (if it has that ability) when player gets too close

missile_range - Maximum distance the player can be from the monster to be allowed to use it's ranged attack.

min_missile_range - Minimum distance the player can be from the monster to be allowed to use it's ranged attack.

bypass_missile_chance - Chance that a monster will NOT fire it's ranged attack, even when it has a clear shot.  This, in effect, will make the monster come in more often than hang back and fire.  A percentage (0 = always fire/never close in, 100 = never fire/always close in).- must be whole number

jump_chance - every time the monster has the opportunity to jump, what is the chance (out of 100) that he will... (100 = jump every time)- must be whole number

wakeup_distance - How far (max) the player can be away from the monster before it wakes up.  This just means that if the monster can see the player, at what distance should the monster actually notice him and go for him.

DEFAULTS:
mintel					= 64
melee_range				= 48
missile_range			= 1024
min_missile_range		= 64
bypass_missile_chance	= 10
jump_chance				= 100
wakeup_distance			= 1024

NOTE: A value of zero will result in defaults, if you actually want zero as the value, use -1

AMBUSH - Will not be woken up by other monsters or shots from player

ASLEEP - will not appear until triggered

EATING - Chomp chomp... chewie chomp

WANDER - Monster will wander around aimlessly (but follows buoys)

MELEE_LEAD - Monster will try to cut you off when you're running and fighting him, works well if there are a few monsters in a group, half doing this, half not

STALK - Monster will only approach and attack from behind- if you're facing the monster it will just stand there.  Once the monster takes pain, however, it will stop this behaviour and attack normally

COWARD - Monster starts off in flee mode- runs away from you when woken up

"homebuoy" - monsters will head to this buoy if they don't have an enemy ("homebuoy" should be targetname of the buoy you want them to go to)

"wakeup_target" - monsters will fire this target the first time it wakes up (only once)

"pain_target" - monsters will fire this target the first time it gets hurt (only once)

mintel - monster intelligence- this basically tells a monster how many buoys away an enemy has to be for it to give up.

melee_range - How close the player has to be, maximum, for the monster to go into melee.  If this is zero, the monster will never melee.  If it is negative, the monster will try to keep this distance from the player.  If the monster has a backup, he'll use it if too clode, otherwise, a negative value here means the monster will just stop running at the player at this distance.

		melee_range = 0 - monster will never do a mele attack
		melee_range = -100 - monster will never do a melee attack and will back away (if it has that ability) when player gets too close

missile_range - Maximum distance the player can be from the monster to be allowed to use it's ranged attack.

min_missile_range - Minimum distance the player can be from the monster to be allowed to use it's ranged attack.

bypass_missile_chance - Chance that a monster will NOT fire it's ranged attack, even when it has a clear shot.  This, in effect, will make the monster come in more often than hang back and fire.  A percentage (0 = always fire/never close in, 100 = never fire/always close in).- must be whole number

jump_chance - every time the monster has the opportunity to jump, what is the chance (out of 100) that he will... (100 = jump every time)- must be whole number

wakeup_distance - How far (max) the player can be away from the monster before it wakes up.  This just means that if the monster can see the player, at what distance should the monster actually notice him and go for him.

The big, nasty, tyranical Overlords..

AMBUSH - Will not be woken up by other monsters or shots from player

ASLEEP - will not appear until triggered

WALKING- Use WANDER instead

WANDER - Monster will wander around aimlessly (but follows buoys)

MELEE_LEAD - Monster will tryto cut you off when you're running and fighting him, works well if there are a few monsters in a group, half doing this, half not

STALK - Monster will only approach and attack from behind- if you're facing the monster it will just stand there.  Once the monster takes pain, however, it will stop this behaviour and attack normally

COWARD - Monster starts off in flee mode- runs away from you when woken up

"homebuoy" - monsters will head to this buoy if they don't have an enemy ("homebuoy" should be targetname of the buoy you want them to go to)

"wakeup_target" - monsters will fire this target the first time it wakes up (only once)

"pain_target" - monsters will fire this target the first time it gets hurt (only once)

mintel - monster intelligence- this basically tells a monster how many buoys away an enemy has to be for it to give up.

melee_range - How close the player has to be, maximum, for the monster to go into melee.  If this is zero, the monster will never melee.  If it is negative, the monster will try to keep this distance from the player.  If the monster has a backup, he'll use it if too clode, otherwise, a negative value here means the monster will just stop running at the player at this distance.

A monster touching this trigger will find the buoy with the "pathtarget" targetname and head for it if it can.

This is NOT a touch trigger for a player, only monsters should ever touch it and only if the TOUCH spawnflag is on.

To have a player touch-trigger it, have the player touch a normal trigger that fires this trigger... (sorry!)

Otherwise, acts like a normal trigger.

"pathtarget" - targetname of buoy monster should head to

Touch - should be able to be touch-activated by monsters- NOTE: This will try to force the entity touching the trigger to it's buoy- should NOT be intended to be touched by anything but monsters

IgnoreEnemy - Monster will ignore his enemy until he gets to his target buoy (or until attacked or woken up some other way, working on preventing this if desired)

TeleportSafe - Make monster teleport to target buoy only if there is nothing there and the player cannot see the monster and/or desination buoy

TeleportUnSafe - Same as TeleportSafe, but ignores whether or not the player can see the monster and/or desination buoy

If you wish to make an assassin teleport to a buoy, use TeleportUnsafe since he doesn't need to hide the teleport from the player

FIXED - Upon arriving at the target buoy, the monster will become fixed and wait for an enemy (will not move from that spot no matter what)

STAND - Upon arriving at the target buoy, the monster will forget any aenemy it has and simply stand around there until it sees another enemy

WANDER - Upon arriving at the target buoy, the monster will forget any aenemy it has and begin to wander around that buoy's vicinity
