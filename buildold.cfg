/*
Quest auto building configuration file
Copyright 1998, 1998 Alexander Malmberg


If you're used to using the go1-6.bat files, this build .cfg file will
emulate that pretty good. Note that the last alternative in Quest is really
go1.bat with just the visible part of the map. If you used to use shell
scripts in these files, stick '#!/bin/sh' (or whatever) at the top of
each command list, change %M to %N, and it should work.
