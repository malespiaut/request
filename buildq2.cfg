/*
Quest auto building configuration file
Copyright 1998, 1998 Alexander Malmberg


Quick start (for detailed information, continue down):

First, make sure qbsp3, qvis3, and qrad3 are somewhere in your path. Then,
change row one, two, and three to reflect your Quake 2 directory. For example,
if Quake is installed in 'c:\games\quake2', the lines should read:

copy %M.bsp c:\games\quake2\baseq2\maps
c:
cd \games\quake2

*/
{
copy %M.bsp d:\Quake2\baseq2\maps
d:
cd \Quake2
quake2 +map %n
pause
}

/*
Detailed information
--------------------

Examples assume the map is 'c:/quest/maps/test.map'. The directories
will be absolute, so they'll work even if you switch directory.

This:   Replaced with this:
  %%     %
  %n     Just the name ('test').
  %N     Name with directory, forward slashes ('c:/quest/maps/test').
  %M     Name with directory, backslashes ('c:\quest\maps\test').


Format:

"Description"
{
command 1
command 2
etc
}

It will appear in Quest with the description. If selected, Quest will run
the commands. If the user said to run the game, Quest will run the game 
(the first build config).

All configurations will start in the directory you started Quest in.
The command list will actually be written to a .bat file, so you can
use any .bat file stuff you like (you can even create shell scripts
if you want to).

First entry is the command to run the game, including copying maps around,
and has no description.
