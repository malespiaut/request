| Quest log of changes, etc |
+---------------------------+


  version 2.4
+-------------+
Released March 28 2000.

Features added:
---------------
*  Quake 3 support. Detailed information on editing Quake 3 is in
  quake3.txt .

*  Sin and Heretic 2 support. They both work mostly like Quake 2 support.
  See quest.cfg for details on setting it up.

*  Quake 3 bezier patch support. Create a bezier patch array with
  Curve->Create in the menu. Each patch is a 3 by 3 array of vertices. The
  corner vertices define the position of the corners, and the vertices
  in-between change the shape of the curve. Curves can be edited mostly like
  normal brushes.
   To change texture alignment on curves selecet a curve (only one) and hit
  ctrl-e. You then get a dialog where you can change the texture coordinates
  at each vertex. Texture coordinates are given in multiples of the texture
  size. The 'Reset' button resets the texture coordinates. The 'Fit' button
  will fit the texture coordinates, i.e. it will calculate place the texture
  coordinates at all vertices, using the top left and bottom right corners
  as a reference. The 'Even' button is like fit, but instead of just using
  linear values between corners, it will use the shape of the curve in the
  calculations to get a more even alignment (i.e. texels will be the same
  size all over the curve). If you hit the 'Natural' button you get to
  select a major axis, and once you've done that, Quest will align the
  texture on the face is if it were a normal face (but with scale 0.5). This
  is useful when you want the texture to line up with textures on nearby
  faces.
   Curves aren't display in any of the BSP-modes, but they are display in
  the z-buffered polygon view mode.

*  The z-buffered polygon view is now texture-mapped and allows editing.
  Click on a brush or a face (any part of it that you can see) to
  select it. Vertices are selected like in normal 3d views (shift+drag
  mouse). This mode is still a bit slow, but it's very useful when you
  want to see changes as you make them.

*  You can also align textures in the map view now. Select one or several
  faces or brushes, and hit ctrl-key arrows to move the texture, and
  ctrl-shift-key arrows to scale it. In polygon mode, you can see the
  changes as you make them. These keys are also useful when you want to
  change the alignment of many faces or brushes at the same time.
   If you select a curve, only the ctrl-keys work (not ctrl-shift-arrows).
  Also, if you select some vertices on the curve, only the texture
  coordinates at those vertices are changed.

*  When you hold down the shift or ctrl for a while to select an entity or a
  brush/face and there are several entities/brushes/faces under the cursor,
  a window will pop up with a list of the entities/etc. near the cursor,
  so you can select one from the list. The list will be sorted by distance
  from the camera (closest first).

*  In the face edit dialog, you can choose to align, scale, or flip
  in only one direction (x or y) or both. You can also click the numbers
  for shift/scale/rotate and enter new values directly.

*  The entity editor can now help you edit a lot of entities. Right click
  on a supported key and you'll get a dialog with choices. This is used for
  many entities in the Quake, Quake 2, Quake 3, Halflife, Sin and Heretic 2
  entity sets. Among other things, it allows you to easily set colors for
  lights, set texture for decals (Halflife) and select stuff from lists
  (sounds, models, light styles, etc.). This is controlled in the entity
  set files, so you can easily have your own entity sets use these features.
  Look at the existing entity sets or contact me for information.

*  General UI improvements. Some dialogs are now using new GUI elements, so
  they'll (hopefully) look and behave better. All text boxes should also
  work better, and you should be able to exit from every dialog with
  enter or escape.

*  Quest now runs on Linux (i386 svgalib and X11). A big thanks to
  Stephan Kanthak and everyone else who helped with this.

*  Customizable viewports. Use 'View->3/4 viewports' to switch between
  the standard 3 viewport view and a 4 viewport view. If you feel brave
  you can manually edit .map files to support any arrangment of up to 5
  viewports.

*  From Tony McDonald: New primitives: dodecahedron, icosahedron, buckyball,
  and torus. They can all be found under 'Brush->Create->' in the menu.

*  If you want to get the distance between two points in a 2d viewport,
  move the cursor to the first point, hit ctrl-d, and then move the cursor
  around to get the distance to the new point.

Changes:
--------
*  If you use the rotate brush command when you have vertices selected,
  only the selected vertices will be rotated (around their center). If no
  vertices are selected, it behaves like before, i.e. the entire brushes
  are rotated.


Bugs fixed:
-----------
*  BSP tree generating is now much better. It will detect and handle all
  errors, so even if some advanced geometry messes up the BSP tree locally,
  you'll still be able to see most of the map. Handles special textures
  (water, lava, etc.) for more games.

*  Handling textures when you're editing multiple maps should work much
  better now.

*  Loading and saving groups work again.

*  Lots of minor bugfixes.


Known bugs:
-----------
*  Not all colors will fade with distance in non-fullbright mode.
   Also, in non-fullbright mode in 2d views, entities with the same z value
  as the camera will only be drawn sometimes. Non-fullbright and 2d
  seems strange anyway. I always turn fullbright on, at least in 2d views.

*  Quest won't run under Windows NT.

Todo:
-----
*  Make mirroring curves work.

*  Make BSP, textured, and solid view even more faster???

*  OpenGL support?


  version 2.36
+--------------+
Released December 31 1998.

Features added:
---------------
*  Halflife support. Just set everything in quest.cfg correctly and it should
  work fine. The entity set is a bit crude, but it's complete and accurate,
  so it should work. Halflife uses 16 bit color textures, and Quest is
  a 256 color program, so I need to dither the textures before displaying
  them. This reduces quality some, but it's very fast and the results are
  quite good. Halflife support uses the same texture cache system as
  the Quake 2 support. Model drawing is not in, yet.

*  The texture picker and face editor dialogs are dithered (sort of)
  while drawn, so they'll come up all right no matter what palette you're
  using. For Quake and Quake 2 there's hardly any difference, but it was
  neccesary for the palette I use for Halflife textures, and also helps
  with other palettes (Hexen 2's should work better now, too).

*  Simon Churchill has made a powerful Quake 1 compiling configuration.
  It can be found in bldq1_2.cfg. Instructions for it are in the file. Also
  thanks to Simon Churchill for enhancing the menu.

Changes:
--------
*  Removed some stuff from the menus (texture remover and fullscreen all).
  Also removed the old texture adder for Quake 2. Some old, unused stuff
  was removed from 'quest.cfg'.

Bugs fixed:
-----------
*  The odd BSP crashes should be fixed now (at least the causes for them
  I know).

*  Improved some internal CSG stuff. Loading complex, old style .map files 
  should no longer cause damaged brushes.


  version 2.35
+--------------+
Released November 14 1998.

Features added:
---------------
*  BSP modes use span-buffering. This means no overdraw, and that makes the
  textured BSP modes MUCH faster.

*  New automatic map building system. Copy buildq1.cfg or buildq2.cfg to
  build.cfg (depending on which game your using), and see that file for
  additional instructions. The building system can be accessed in Quest
  by pressing Alt-B. Cancel closes the dialog without doing anything.
  Run game toggles whether you want to run the game after compiling the
  map (build configuration 0). Only visible toggles whether the actual .map
  file is passed to the building utils or if Quest should write a new .map
  file with only the currently visible groups in it. Add shell can only
  be on if Only visible is on. If Add shell is on, Quest will add a shell
  around your map, thus ensuring there are no leaks. This allows you to test
  unclosed parts of your map easily. After you've made your choices, click
  on the button corresponding to the build configuration you want to use.
  The included buildq1.cfg and buildq2.cfg contains some examples, but it
  is easy to add your own.

*  Leak finder. Select 'Misc->Find leak' in the menu and Quest will try to
  find a leak in your map. If it finds a leak, it will be displayed as a line
  from the outside of the map to an entity. The leak is somewhere along the
  line. Very complicated architecture may cause the algorithm to fail. If so,
  use qbsp/qbsp3 to find leaks and use 'File->Load .pts/.lin' to see where it
  is.

*  Lighted and shadowed preview. Just pick 'Misc->Lighted preview' or
  'Misc->Shadowed preview' from the menu and the current viewport will
  switched to lighted/shadowed preview mode. Hit F3, T, or any other
  key that switches to another mode to turn lighted preview off. Lighted
  and especially shadowed preview is very slow, so it will update the screen
  as it draws. It can handle both Quake's and Quake 2's lighting models,
  although radiosity isn't supported, and light emitting faces aren't split.

*  The Face edit dialog has Flip buttons. These multiply the texture scale
  by -1 in the axis you choose.

*  The menu is loaded directly from 'menu.txt'. 'menu.dat' is no longer used.
  If you are brave, you can customize the menu now.


  Thanks to Gyro Gearloose for submitting the following three features.

*  New primitive, pyramid. Select 'Brush->Create->Pyramid' in the menu.

*  Snap to vertex. Select some vertices to snap and hit U. If you only
  selected one vertex, that one will be used as a 'handle', otherwise
  select the handle and hit the right mouse button. After that select the
  vertex to snap to, and hit the right mouse button. Quest will now move
  the vertices so the 'handle' vertex is aligned with the vertex to snap
  to, while keeping them arranged like before.

*  Brush joining. Select two brushes and hit J. Quest will create a new
  brush from all planes in the brushes that don't intersect any face in the
  original brushes. It's like taking the outer faces of the brushes and
  creating a new one from them.


  version 2.3
+-------------+
Released August 15 1998.

Features added:
---------------
*  New texture system. Pressing Ctrl-T brings up the new texture
  picker/adder. The left list is a list of all categories. The right
  list has all textures in the current category. To select a category
  or texture click on it. The selected texture will be drawn in the big
  area to the right. Flags, contents, and value will appear underneath.
  You can create new categories with the New button, and delete categories
  with the Delete button. The *All* category contains all textures. The
  *Unassigned* contains all texture not in any other category. These
  categories are standard and can't be deleted. The other categories are
  user defined. To place a texture in a category, drag it from the texture
  list to the category, using the RIGHT mouse button. When you've selected
  a texture, use the Done button to exit the dialog. The fullscreen button
  will bring up the fullscreen texture picker with the textures in the
  current category. The cache button toggles whether only textures in the
  cache are displayed (default), or all textures. The Add button adds the
  selected texture to the cache. When all textures are displayed, the
  fullscreen button lets you add textures instead of selecting them (like
  Fullscreen all, but with only textures in the current category). I've
  included some sample categories that you can base your categories on,
  or you could delete all of them and start from scratch.

*  New, neat way to create brushes. In a 2d viewport, hold down control and
  shift and click somewhere. A vertex will appear where you clicked, and
  you can continue clicking to add more vertices and define a shape. Click
  on the first vertex when you're done, and Quest will create a brush with
  that shape. Right-clicking will also close the shape. Click on the last
  vertex to delete it. In the third dimension, Quest will place according
  to where the viewport is placed, unless you had a brush selected when
  you started creating this brush. If so, Quest will use the selected
  brush's size. The new brush will be selected after you're done, so if
  you're creating many brushes that have the same size, you only need
  to adjust the first one. After that, keep it selected when you create
  the next brush and it will have the same size. It's a bit hard to
  explain, but try it, I've found this feature to be very useful, and
  I use it almost exclusively to create new brushes.

*  The BSP modes are faster and use less memory.

*  item_tech1-4 removed from the Q2 CTF entity set.

Bugs fixed:
-----------
*  Some internal CSG stuff would break sometimes.

*  The fullscreen texture picker wouldn't work if there were too many
  textures.


  version 2.28
+--------------+
Released July 12 1998.

First version distributed under GNU GPL.

Bugs fixed:
-----------
*  Strings in the face editor would sometimes be misplaced.

Features added:
---------------
*  3-point clipping plane. Hit Shift-C to create one. It can be manipulated
  just like a brush. To use it, select the brushes to split, hit Shift-S,
  select the clipping plane, hit the right mouse button, and the brushes
  will be split.

*  Editing multiple faces. You can select many faces with the same normal
  and edit them at once in the face editor. They will then all have the
  same texture and alignment. Also, the auto-align has been split into
  auto-align and auto-scale, and they behave slightly differently.


  version 2.27
+--------------+
Released June 18 1998.

Features added:
---------------
*  Perspective correcting texture mapper. Press Shift-T to use it. It's very
  slow, but it looks very good. The old, ugly, fast one can still be used
  by pressing 'T'.

*  All BSP modes are MUCH faster (old textured ~20, others ~70%).

*  Removal of duplicate textures for Quake 2. If you delete your current
  'textures.dat', Quest will generate a new one and use 'textures.dup' to
  remove the duplicates. This file has a precompiled lists of duplicates
  based on image data, and covers Quake 2's and the point release's textures.
  If you have used textures that are now removed, use
  'Textures->Fix duplicates' to replace them with the corresponding remaining
  texture.

*  Quake 2 sound list in the entity editor. Right click on a 'noise' key
  and you'll get a list of all Quake 2 sounds in the 'world/' directory,
  with descriptions. The list was written by Gary Marshall.

*  New stuff you create will always be placed in a visible group. This makes
  it possible to work with the 'World' group hidden.


  version 2.26
+--------------+
Released May 24 1998.

Bugs fixed:
-----------
*  Brush copying had a harmless bug that caused Quest to crash under
  some DPMI servers.

*  Brush welding had some problems. They're fixed now, and welding a lot
  of brushes is MUCH faster.

*  Keyboard entity movement left didn't work.

Features added:
---------------
*  Support for a profiles system. Using the Quest front end, you can define
  profiles and use them in Quest. This will allow you to easily edit
  maps for different mods/games. Note that Quest can't switch profiles
  while running, so if you want to use a different profile, you'll have
  to exit Quest and start it again. If called with a map on the command
  line, Quest will switch to that map's profile.

*  In the Texture adder, there is a Fullscreen button. Use this to
  bring up the fullscreen texture picker with the textures in the
  current directory. Textures with a white frame are already in the cache.
  Click on a texture to add it to the cache. Right-click when done. The
  'Textures->Fullscreen all' menu option will bring this up with ALL
  textures.

*  Quest will now load and save which textures are in the cache, even those
  that aren't actually used in the map.

*  Added some warnings when building maps if you haven't saved changes.


  version 2.25
+--------------+
Released April 28 1998.

Features added:
---------------
*  Texture locking. Toggle with 'e'. This will attempt to keep the
  textures correctly aligned to the faces. Note that skewing textures
  isn't possible, so the texture locking won't work there.

*  New map format. No vertex drifting at all. Smaller files. Faster
  loading. Set 'map2' to 1 if you want to use it. I've also released a new
  version of qbsp3 that can load the new format. Quest can still save the
  old format (set 'map2' to 0), and it will automatically load both the old
  and new format. You can change 'map2' while in Quest, just bring up the
  Preferences dialog (Ctrl-P). It's somewhere near the bottom.

*  Multiple maps open at the same time. Switch maps with Alt-1 to Alt-5. You
  can copy and paste between maps. Remember to save all maps before exiting.
  You can now add several files to Quest's command line, and it'll load them
  all.

*  MUCH faster texture mapping.

*  I rearranged the directories. All entity sets can now be found under
  the 'es' directory. The new Rocket Arena 2 entity set can also be found
  here. It's basically the normal Quake 2 entity set with some stuff
  removed, and some comments updated.

*  Hide all but selected. Select some brushes/entities, and hit Ctrl-H.
  Everything but the ones you selected will disappear. Hit Ctrl-H to make
  everything else appear again.

*  Grey scale shaded view. Activate with Alt-H. Uses the BSP mode.

*  Keyboard entity movement. Use Shift-Arrows and Shift-Page up and
  Shift-Page down.

*  Movement of stuff in freelook viewports will be snapped to the
  nearest axis. Also, you can use Shift-Page up and Shift-Page down to
  move vertices/entities towards/away from the camera.

*  You can now access the texture adder from the texture picker.

*  The texture adder has a fullscreen mode. Hit the fullscreen button and
  Quest will bring up the fullscreen texture picker with all the textures
  in the current directory. The ones with a white frame are already in the
  cache. Click on a texture to add it. Right click when you're done.

*  Popup menu. Set 'pop_menu' to 2 to use it. The menu will only appear
  when you right click (not drag), or if you click the third mouse button
  (if you have one). Click outside the menu, or click the right/third mouse
  button again to close it, or pick a command as usual.

*  The face editor has been changed. It will now position itself in the
  lower left corner of the screen, and will change size depending on the
  size of the face being edited.

*  Brush weld. Select lots of brushes. Hit 'w'. Quest will now attempt
  to combine the brushes. If you selected lots of brushes, this will take
  lots of time. Note that for Quest to weld two brushes, the resulting brush
  must be convex. Also, the two original brushes must be attached to the same
  entity, and they may not have two identical planes with the same texture
  (although different alignment doesn't matter).

*  Messages in the status bar now have a number in front of them, so you
  can see if it gets updated.

*  Added some checking to the consistency checker. Should now find brushes
  with 'bad normal' errors. They'll be flagged as 'Degenerated edge!'.

Bugs fixed:
-----------
*  BSP mode should work without any textures at all now.


  version 2.21
+--------------+
Released April 04 1998.

Bugs fixed:
-----------
*  Using BSP or textured mode error messages is fixed now. It wasn't
  completely fixed in the last version.

*  Link lines (target/targetname) in model mode weren't always drawn.

Features added:
---------------
*  MDL and MD2 viewing. Make sure mdlpaks and draw_models are correct in
  quest.cfg, start Quest, and go to entity mode. Not all entities have
  models, but a lot of them have.

*  Hexen 2 support. Set quake2 to 0 and point classdir at qchexen2/*.qc.

*  The entity edit dialog now has the ability to easily edit some
  keys. Those keys will be drawn in a light grey color, instead of black.
  Select one and press Edit, or right click on it, and you'll get a
  dialog for that key. Currently supported keys are classname, which
  brings up the entity picker, and _color, which brings up a color
  editing dialog. See the Quest manual for more info.

*  In model mode, Quest now draws a pink line to indicate
  pathtarget/targetname relations.

*  The undo system is now complete. Everything is undoable.

Changes:
--------
*  The keyboard increase and decrease depth clip behave differently now.

*  Made the text editing cursor easier to see (red).

  version 2.2
+-------------+
Released March 28 1998.

Bugs fixed:
-----------
*  If you tried to use BSP or textured preview without having the textures,
  you'd get one error message per face. Now you only get one per redraw.

Features added:
---------------
*  Quest is now compiled with GCC 2.8.0 with instruction rescheduling, so it
  is faster than the previous versions (at least on Pentiums and later).

*  Undo system! Make some changes, and then press Ctrl-Z. Quest will now undo
  them. It's a 5 level undo system, and it can undo almost everything.
  However, the CSG Subtraction can't currently be undone.

*  New way to split faces! Select a face. Select an edge (ie. two vertices).
  Press Alt-S. Select another edge. Press the right mouse button. The two
  edges will be split in half, and the face will be split with an edge
  thru the two new vertices.

*  Bookmarks in the fullscreen texture selector. Use Alt-1..0 to define a
  bookmark, and 1..0 to go to it.

*  You can hold down the keys when moving vertices with the keyboard.

*  A new setting in quest.cfg, snap_to_int. When set to 1 (default), Quest
  will snap all vertices to integer positions when saving the map. This
  might fix problems with vertex drifting.

*  In quest.cfg, you can now control the mouse sensitivity in both the x and
  y axis.

*  Improved CSG subtraction. Quest will now split with the axis-aligned
  planes before the non-axis-aligned ones. This improves the result in some
  cases, for example when subtracting prisms from cubes.

*  Quest can now load the .pts and .lin files generated by qbsp and qbsp3.
  This should help you track leaks. Use File->Load PTS to load the file.
  Toggle the display of the lines with 'L'. The lines will show up red, with
  the ends marked with blue and green. The leak is somewhere along the line.
   QBSP3 (for Quake2) generates a really useful lin file, and finding leaks
  using it is easy.
   Old qbsp (for Quake) generates a pts file with hundreds of points, most
  of them unnecessesary. Finding leaks using this is not as easy, but it
  should point you in the right direction.

*  Quake 2 specific: You can use the keyboard in the Texture adder. Press a
  letter and Quest will jump to the first texture starting with that letter.
  You can also use up, down, home, end, and enter to navigate.

*  The texture information for Quake 2 editing is saved to textures.dat. This
  means Quest will load a lot faster again. If you add textures to your
  texture directories, delete textures.dat and Quest will regenerate it the
  next time you start it.

Changes:
--------
*  I've rewritten the configuration file system to avoid some old problems.

*  In textured preview, Quest will only texture map faces within the
  depth clip distance. The other faces will be drawn in a single color.


  version 2.12
+--------------+
Released March 15 1998.

Bugs fixed:
-----------
*  The 'Unable to set requested video mode' error that some of you were
  getting should be fixed now.


  version 2.11
+--------------+
Release March 14 1998.

Features added:
---------------
*  Added keyboard vertex movement again. In face or brush mode, select the
  vertices you want to move, and use shift-arrows to move them.

*  Added support for Quest to load the textures directly from the pak files.
  See wadfilename in quest.cfg for instructions on how to do this. This also
  means Quest will build a list a all textures upon startup, which might take
  some time (3 seconds on my P90).

Bugs fixed:
-----------
*  The Quake 2 texture adder (Textures->Select textures) had a bug in it that
  made some textures not appear. With the new texture system, this should be
  fixed.

*  The code to handle video cards with granularities that weren't 64kb was
  buggy. I hope this will fix most of the strange video problems.

*  There was a strange bug in the keyboard system that hardly ever appeared,
  but I found it while adding keyboard vertex movement.

*  If there weren't any textures, the texture picker would come up garbled.
  Now it gives you an error message instead.

Changes:
--------
*  If you call Quest with the new of a map without the extension, Quest will
  now automatically add '.map'.

*  The texture picker will now allow '/' and '\' in texture names. '\'s will
  be converted to '/'s.

*  The coordinates for the second grid will now only be displayed if you 
  aren't zoomed out too much.

*  The dump core question upon unrecoverable errors has been removed, as it
  wasn't useful for normal users anyway.

*  Creating a new entity will switch you to entity mode.


  version 2.1
+-------------+
Released March 12 1998.

Bugs fixed:
-----------
*  If class_dir was incorrectly set in quest.cfg, the entity picker would
  crash.

*  Unloading a map (eg. when loading or creating a new map) would zero out
  the wadfilename. This is good in Quake, but is causes the new Quake 2 map
  to not be able to load the textures.

Features added:
---------------
*  Textured preview!!! Just enter BSP mode with F3, and press 't'. Then
  wait a while, and eventually the viewport should become textured. This
  is REALLY slow, and as the texture mapping is all linear, it looks pretty
  bad sometimes. But still, it gives you a good impression of what the level
  is going to look like, and it's faster than building the level and starting
  Quake/Quake 2. As it uses BSP mode, you'll have to rebuild the BSP tree
  with shift-F3 to see any changes you make to the level.
   The normal (non-textured) BSP mode has also been changed. Instead of
  assigning colors at random (almost), it will calculate an average color
  for the texture and draw the face with that color. This looks much better
  than the old way, and is just as fast.
   If you want the textured preview to look like Quake, you'll have to
  switch to Quake's palette. This can be done with shift-P. Ctrl-shift-P
  should switch back to Quest's palette.

*  I also added a debug mode. Run:
     quest -D > debug.txt
  and Quest will output debugging info to debug.txt. If you have strange
  problems with the video system, this is what should run, and then send
  me the file.


  version 2.0
+-------------+
Released March 09 1998.

Bugs fixed:
-----------
*  Button system would leak buttons, especially the group dialog. It would
  eventually overflow and overwrite memory.

*  Edit face dialog would leak bitmaps, eventually leading to a crash.

*  Grid drawer would sometimes try to draw the grid outside the window,
  resulting in blue lines across the screen and/or overwritten memory.

*  BSP functions referenced the real map data, so if you changed something,
  the change would be semi-reflected in BSP mode. This made it draw
  everything wrong or crash.

*  In BSP mode, the face drawing function would sometimes crash.

*  Copy and paste have been fixed. Previously they only made a reference
  to the brush/entity you copied, and duplicated it when you pasted. If
  you edited the original after copying, the change would appear in the
  copy too. If you deleted the original and then pasted, it would crash.

*  Lots of other stuff I forgot.


Changes:
--------
*  Should an unrecoverable error happen, Quest will make an attempt to save
  the current map to 'q_backup.map' before terminating.


Features added:
---------------
*  Quake2 support. Quest can load and save the new Quake2 fields. The
  texture system has been upgraded to handle Quake2 textures.

*  New dialog, Surface flags (Alt-F, face|brush mode), used to modify the
  Quake2 specific fields of faces. All selected faces and faces on selected
  brushes will be edited with this command.

*  Quest can now be run from any directory. For most files, it will look
  in first the current directory and then the directory 'quest.exe' is
  in. This allows you to only have one version of Quest installed and still
  edit both Quake and Quake 2. All you need to do is have multiple quest.cfg
  files and run Quest from the directory containing the one you want to use.

*  Textures are completely cached, they will only be loaded once.

*  The face dialog has support for rotation, and will display ALL faces
  correctly (I hope). There is also a auto-align button. This will attempt
  to align a texture automatically by scaling and shifting it. It won't
  rotate, and only works (properly) with rectangular faces.

*  Two grids are now drawn, a dark-blue, normal one and a light-blue one,
  every fourth normal grid line. Thus, if you set the gridsize to 16,
  you will get one grid with a size of 16, and one with a size of 64.
  You will also see coordinates for every fourth grid line.

*  New CSG function, Make Hollow (H, brush mode). This will make all selected
  brushes hollow. The resulting brushes will have a perfect interior and
  exterior surface,  but will overlap.

*  Another new CSG function, Make Room (R, brush mode). This is like Make
  Hollow, except it won't bother about the exterior. It will create a perfect
  interior and no overlapping brushes.

*  The entire keyboard configuration is read from 'key.cfg'. This allows you
  to customize it to your liking. The menu system also uses the commands
  described in 'key.cfg', so you can easily bind keys to your favorite
  menu commands.

*  The old entity/script handling has been removed and replaced with a much
  better (IMO) system.
   The new system will parse the files selected in 'quest.cfg' to find valid
  classnames and information about them. For Quake, the files parsed should
  be the .qc files, and for Quake2, the .c files in the game/ directory.
  Both are available for download from a lot of places.
   The entities are no longer drawn using the .mdl file. Instead the exact
  clip sizes will be used to draw a simple box. While this doesn't look as
  pretty as the .mdl files, it allows you to see exactly how big entities
  are and place them correctly.
   The script system has been replaced by a model system. Entities with
  brushes (models) will be displayed with their origin at the center of its
  brushes and the box will have extents of them. This allows you to select,
  edit, and move models just like normal entities. You can also copy and
  paste models.
   The entity editor, used for both entities and models, will display all
  information it has about the classname, and allows you to edit any key.
  You can also edit many entities at the same time. It should be easy to
  use. Just select a entity and press Ctrl-E. The window will have three
  parts. The first displays available help for this entity, the second
  will list all valid spawnflags, allowing you to easily change them,
  and the third lists all keys/values. To add a new key/value, just click
  in the "new key" field at the bottom and type the key, press enter, and
  then type the value (and press enter). The new key/value should now
  appear in the list.
   The entity picker has been redone, and is very different.

*  Vertex/edge/face merging is implemented. Just drag two vertices over
  each other and they will be merged, removing edges and faces as needed.
  This is a good way to create degenerated brushes.

*  Edge/face splitting is also implemented.
   In face mode, select two vertices on the same edge and press Ctrl-L. A
  new vertices will be created between the two original vertices.
   To split a face, select it and two vertices not on the same edge. A new
  edge will be created between the two vertices and the face will be split.

*  A freelook mode has been implemented. While in a 3d mode, press V and
  the turn keys will turn in 5 degree steps instead of 90 degrees. If you
  feel brave, you can also edit in this mode, although it is primarily
  useful for selecting.

*  Map info dialog (Ctrl-I). Tells you how many brushes, entities, and
  models your map contains. Also give information about used targets and
  teams, to simplify usage of these.

*  Model dialog (Ctrl-M, entity|model mode). Gives you a list of all models
  in the map, and how many brushes they have. This allows you to edit/delete
  models you can't select any other way.

*  The message system will only save the last 10 messages, so as not to eat
  too much memory.

*  The screenshot function will now compress the output file.

*  Support for VBE 2.0 and linear frame buffer. This speeds up drawing
  pretty much.
